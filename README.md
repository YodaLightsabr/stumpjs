## Usage
The `Stump` class is invoked with two arguments: features and settings. The `Debug` feature enables the `debug` and `verbose` log messages. The `Discord` feature enables posting to a Discord webhook and requires the `webhook` parameter in the settings object.

To enable timestamps, add the `Timestamp` feature.
